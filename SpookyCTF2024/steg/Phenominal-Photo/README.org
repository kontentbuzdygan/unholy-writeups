* Phenominal-Photo
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Simon was spotted dwelling under the clock-tower yet again, this time taking pictures. He seems to have captured a strange object in the far far distance going left, right, up, and down seemingly lost or out of control. There is a strange aura radiating from the photo, pulsations even, like an SOS. Can you figure out this strange phenomenon??

Running =binwalk= on the image outputs a directory with a file =Map.txt= and a password protected zip =gps.zip=. Contents of the Map.txt look like a Minecraft Enchantment Table language:

Typing the first few letters into Google search gives a few hits of an "Alien Language Cipher". Decoding the text with an online tool gives a following result:

#+BEGIN_SRC
MAP: LEFT, UP, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, UP, LEFT, RIGHT, UP

REMINDER THAT OUR GPS IS A LITTLE FUNKY, IT ONLY TAKES THE FIRST LETTER OF EACH DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO (STUPID MEMORY MANAGEMENT)

From this we can construct a password to the zip =LUDLDRRDLULRU=, which contains a =myrequest.txt=, which is also encoded in Alien Language Cipher:

=⋏⟟☊☊{⊑⟒⌰⌿_⋔⟒_⎎⟟⋏⎅_⏁⊑⟒_⌿⌰⏃⋏⟒⏁_⏚0⍜}=

This gets translated into:

=NICC{HELP_ME_FIND_THE_PLANET_B0O}=
